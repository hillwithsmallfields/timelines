# timelines

A program to take a sequence of intervals from a CSV file, and output
in graphical form as columns where the events in each column don't
overlap.

The CSV file must have these columns:
  - Begin date
  - End date
  - Subject
  - Area
  
I wrote this to help me visualize things like "Which scientists were
active while Bach was composing?" etc.
